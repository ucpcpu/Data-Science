# Data-Science
This Repository on Data Science contains some of the projects I did.
Some of them are in

1. Natural Language Processing
2. Some Claqssification Models
3. Regression Models
4. Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)

However One Should go to my model for image prediction using Neural Networks
 that is done using varying number of Neural Networks and varying the Learning Rates 
and good observations on Loss of Information have been observed.
